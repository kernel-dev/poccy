# Poccy

Poccy, whilst still a WIP, is a toy OS I've built in my spare time for a school project. More precisely, I am doing my senior's paper/thesis on operating systems and kernels, and am providing this one as an example to detail how one may go about kernel/OS development.

## Goals

- [x] Custom bootloader to obtain basic information necessary, load the kernel image and call it with passed down arguments.
- [x] Graphics methods for handling plotting pixels to the screen
- [x] Handling drawing glyphs on the screen from a font file
- [ ] Filesystem handler
- [ ] Memory management (pagers, vmem functions, etc.)
- [ ] Mutex locks for threads
- [ ] Basic Bash & C support
- [ ] PS/2 Keyboard support
- [ ] ACPICA implementation
- [ ] DSDT parser to expose the table in plaintext
- [ ] Basic math library (logarithms, pow(), etc.)

## Credits / Resources

- [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) - for providing me, and a plentiful of other users, with the common knowledge as an introduction for OS development.
- [Tianocore](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) - for providing UEFI utilities and abstractions.
- [Mhaeuser](https://github.com/mhaeuser) â€” for providing this project with an amazing library for PE/COFF images (PeCoffLib2), which was used in the bootloader.
